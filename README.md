# Insurance Linear Regression



This repository contains code and resources for building a linear regression model to predict insurance costs based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, etc.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Insurance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance) from Kaggle. It consists of 1338 records and 7 attributes:

1. **age**: Age of the insured person.
2. **sex**: Gender of the insured person (male or female).
3. **bmi**: Body mass index (BMI) of the insured person.
4. **children**: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance plan.
5. **smoker**: Whether the insured person is a smoker or not (yes or no).
6. **region**: The region where the insured person resides (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest).
7. **charges**: Insurance charges/costs incurred by the insured person.
